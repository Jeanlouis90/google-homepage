Hey guys, JL here, and thank you for checking out my project. This was my very first HTML/CSS/DevTools project, and I have to say, I learned quite a bit, especially in regards to my current workflow. I learned a couple of things:

- The importance and overall usefulness (is that a word) of Developer Tools. It really helps to know where you are at, and how the original core design was built.
- Many CSS tags and the new ways you can use them.
- And most importantly, a little bit of common sense. I was too scared to stray my own path and make my own versions of things. I love doing it now, and want to do more!


Thats it, and if you have any other questions, feel free to send me a message!
